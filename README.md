#OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT: 

This project demonstrates the use of PySpark to perform end-to-end data analysis and processing on a dataset using Apache Spark's powerful distributed computing capabilities. The notebook includes real-world data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation techniques, followed by insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA). It showcases the ability to handle large-scale data using PySpark DataFrames, SQL-like queries, and various Spark functions.

Key aspects include:-

Initializing a SparkSession for data processing

Reading and inspecting large datasets using PySpark

Cleaning data by handling missing/null values and duplicates

Performing data aggregation, filtering, and sorting operations

Using SQL queries in Spark for advanced data querying

Applying groupBy, join, and other transformation operations for analytics



Key Skills:-

Apache Spark & PySpark.

Big Data Processing: Efficient handling of large-scale datasets.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Null value handling, duplicates removal, and schema formatting.

SQL with Spark: Leveraging SQL queries for data manipulation within Spark.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Deriving insights using groupBy, agg, join, filter, and select.
